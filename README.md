# Arrays
An array is a collection of elements of the same type stored in contiguous memory locations. It allows you to store multiple values under a single variable name and access them using an index.

**Arrays are useful when you need to:**
---
Store multiple related values together (e.g., marks of students).
Access elements efficiently using indices.
Perform operations like finding the largest/smallest value, sum, or average.
Reduce the need for creating many separate variables.

*In short:* Arrays make your code organized, efficient, and easier to manage when working with collections of data.
